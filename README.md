# REST Countries API with color theme switcher

## The Task

Your task is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You have to use react-native.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to these designs:

1. https://asset.cloudinary.com/dnv6rpncl/65783550eab4bdc1ea8cab036557d7f4
2. https://asset.cloudinary.com/dnv6rpncl/92528fbc9a68997e9b16c079b769555e
3. https://asset.cloudinary.com/dnv6rpncl/63d5ddd713f1b079d6fcaacfcf3697ee
4. https://asset.cloudinary.com/dnv6rpncl/80d285d25e8e9ae4fc9c1c4be94396e8

In this task, you will find mobile designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets for this task, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Regularly commit the changes.
3. After completing the project, add a step-by-step guide for how to run this project locally.
4. Create distributions for both Android and iOS.
5. Submit the link of this repository with us.
